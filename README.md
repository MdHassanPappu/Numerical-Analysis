# Numerical Analysis

Welcome to the **Numerical Analysis** repository! This repository showcases my learning journey during the first semester of my Numerical Analysis course. It contains notes, Python code implementations, and resources for each topic covered in the course.

## üìö Topics Covered
1. **Notion of Error in Numerical Analysis**
   - Understanding truncation and rounding errors.
   - Error propagation and analysis.

2. **Polynomial Interpolation and Approximation**
   - Techniques like Lagrange interpolation, Newton‚Äôs method, and Chebyshev nodes.

3. **Numerical Derivation and Integration**
   - Methods like finite differences, trapezoidal rule, and Simpson‚Äôs rule.

4. **Numerical Solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**
   - Euler‚Äôs method, Runge-Kutta methods, and stability analysis.

5. **Direct and Iterative Methods for Solving Linear Systems**
   - Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, Jacobi, and Gauss-Seidel methods.

6. **Nonlinear Equations in One and Several Variables**
   - Bisection method, Newton-Raphson method, and multi-variable extensions.

7. **Project and Complementary Topics**
   - Optimization techniques and eigenvalue problems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Prerequisites
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.9+
- Libraries: `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `SciPy` (as required)
- Basic knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations.

## üìÅ Repository Structure
Each topic has its own folder containing:
- **Notes:** Explanations and summaries.
- **Python Code:** Algorithm implementations.
- **Resources:** Additional references.
